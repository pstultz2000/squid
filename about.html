    <h2>A philosophy about… learning perspectives?</h2>
    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p><strong>My philosophy is rooted in a realization I’ve had over the span of my life- that there is always more to learn.<br><br></strong>When we think we are truly beginning to understand something, it’s often just scratching the surface. This is somewhat explained by the Dunning-Kruger Effect- but my philosophy spans way past this narrow conclusion. It is a system in which we need to not just accept, but truly attempt to understand the various perspectives of others and their own trains of logic. Unless we believe we, as individuals, are particularly special (a main character of sorts) broadening our perspective brings us closer to a more ideal, enlightened way of thought.</p>
    <p><strong>Is the “catch-all” conclusion we have on something really the end-all of what is correct?<br><br></strong> What about from another’s perspective? What if we stepped into another person’s shoes- or rather, into their own life? When we obtain this way of thought, and take on an understanding that knowing more is always better than remaining in ignorance (even if our knowledge may be flawed), we continuously improve ourselves and deepen our own understanding of the world around us.</p>
