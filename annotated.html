    <p><strong>Bantinaki, Katerina. "The Paradox of Horror: Fear as a Positive Emotion." The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol. 70, no. 4, Fall 2012, pp. 383–392. JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/43496533. Accessed 16 Nov. 2024.</strong><br><br>Bantinaki’s article discusses the paradoxical relationship between fear and enjoyment in horror art. She argues that fear- despite its negative connotation- can bring about positive emotions when experienced in controlled contexts such as art or literature. By analyzing examples from horror genres, she explains how this fear serves as a form of emotional engagement and intellectual stimulation.
        <br><br>Bantinaki’s insights of fear as a positive emotion challenge our conventional views of fear as inherently negative, which supports my broader philosophy of recontextualizing emotional experiences. Her analysis of controlled fear in horror art shows us the importance of perspective in evaluating our own emotions, showing how fear can provide both enjoyment and intellectual stimulation in the right context. Ultimately, this provides a nuance into perception of fear that is typically overlooked.

<strong>"Beauty Is in the Eye of the Beholder." Phrases.org.uk, https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/beauty-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder.html. Accessed 16 Nov. 2024.</strong><br><br>The article explains the origins and implications of the age-old phrase, attributed to Margaret Wolfe Hungerford. It provides context on how subjective perceptions of beauty can differ widely across various cultures and individuals.
        <br><br>As arguably the most well-known phrase for the subjectivity of beauty- the saying is directly relevant to broader perspectives. By explaining how cultural and personal experiences shape aesthetic judgments, this idea also encourages an appreciation for diversity in tastes, perceptions, and an understanding that flaws can be opinionated.

<strong>Ekman, Paul. "What Is Fear?" Paul Ekman Group, https://www.paulekman.com/universal-emotions/what-is-fear/. Accessed 16 Nov. 2024.</strong><br><br>Ekman’s article focuses on fear as one of the universal emotions. He describes fear as a response to perceived threats, whether real or imagined, and outlines the psychological and physiological effects that accompany it. The article also shares how fear influences our behavior- particularly in survival and decision-making contexts.
        <br><br>Ekman’s detailed explanation of fear’s role, as both a survival mechanism, and emotional experience, gives a deeper understanding of fear’s influence on our perception. By understanding fear as a universal emotion that shapes our actions, the article lines up with the broader philosophical argument of viewing fear within a given context.

<strong>Geher, Glenn. "Perceived and Actual Characteristics of Parents and Partners: A Test of a Freudian Model of Mate Selection." Current Psychology, vol. 19, no. 3, 2000, pp. 194–214. SpringerLink, https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journals/perceived-and-actual-characteristics-of-parents-and-partners-a-test-of-sF65iW9FxI. Accessed 16 Nov. 2024.</strong><br><br>This study investigates the Freudian model of mate selection by analyzing the similarities between perceived characteristics of parents and romantic partners. Using empirical data, Geher found evidence suggesting that individuals often seek out partners who resemble their parents in significant ways, supporting Freudian theories about our early-life influence on mate selection.
        <br><br>Geher’s research provides a scientific basis for understanding how early-life influences shape adult preferences- adding to the discussion of beauty’s subjectivity. By linking parental characteristics to mate selection, the study reinforces the idea that individual preferences are rooted in our own unique experiences.

<strong>"Meet the Man Behind a Third of What’s on Wikipedia." CBS News, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meet-the-man-behind-a-third-of-whats-on-wikipedia/. Accessed 16 Nov. 2024.</strong><br><br>This CBS article profiles Steven Pruitt, the most prolific Wikipedia contributor. It details his dedication to providing free, accessible knowledge, despite receiving no financial compensation. By documenting his extensive contributions, the article showcases how personal passion can lead to impactful achievements beyond real world incentives.
        <br><br>Steven Pruitt’s story demonstrates how success can be defined outside traditional metrics like wealth or recognition, directly supporting my broader philosophy’s focus on individuality for  achievement. His unpaid contributions to Wikipedia showcase the value of passion and intrinsic motivation, sharing the idea that success is deeply personal and varies based on individual values, as well as our priorities.

<strong>Mincey, Barrett, Nancy Maldonado, Candace H. Lacey, and Steve D. Thompson. "Perceptions of Successful Graduates of Juvenile Residential Programs: Reflections and Suggestions for Success." Journal of Correctional Education (1974-), vol. 59, no. 1, March 2008, pp. 8–31. JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/23282643. Accessed 16 Nov. 2024.</strong><br><br>This study examines the reflections of juvenile residential program graduates on their perceptions of success. The authors examine the challenges these individuals faced- such as a lack of positive role models, and how these circumstances shaped their understanding of achievement. The study keys in on the resilience and inner drive of the participants, shedding light on how environments influence our life outcomes.
        <br><br>The study by Mincey et al. shines a light on the importance of environmental and social influences on one’s perception of success- showing perception strongly depends on the individual’s experiences. By examining how adverse conditions shape personal goals, the study provides a concrete example of how success can look vastly different depending on one’s circumstances. This aligns with the idea that understanding diverse perspectives plays a strong role in truly appreciating the complexities of success.

<strong>Nader, Karim, Glenn E. Schafe, and Joseph E. LeDoux. "Fear Memories Require Protein Synthesis in the Amygdala for Reconsolidation after Retrieval." Nature, vol. 406, 2000, pp. 722–726. PubMed, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10963596/. Accessed 16 Nov. 2024.</strong><br><br>This study explores the reconsolidation of fear memories in the amygdala, showing that memories- once retrieved- become malleable and susceptible to change. The authors used protein synthesis inhibitors to demonstrate how disrupting reconsolidation can lead to amnesia, providing key insights into the biological processes underlying memory formation and retrieval.
        <br><br>The findings on memory reconsolidation emphasize the malleability of human recollection, directly supporting the argument that memory is not just a static record, but a fluid construct. By showing how memories can change upon retrieval, the study aligns with my philosophy’s focus on understanding the imperfections of our perceptions, and the value of questioning our own recollections.

<strong>Straube, Benjamin. "An Overview of the Neuro-Cognitive Processes Involved in the Encoding, Consolidation, and Retrieval of True and False Memories." Behavioral and Brain Functions, vol. 8, article 35, 2012, https://behavioralandbrainfunctions.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1744-9081-8-35. Accessed 16 Nov. 2024.</strong><br><br>Straube reviews the processes of memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval, with a focus on the formation of false memories. He explains how errors at each stage- such as misattribution during encoding or misleading information during consolidation- contribute to memory distortions. The article also outlines the various neurocognitive systems involved, offering a broad overview of how false memories arise.
        <br><br>Straube’s comprehensive review of our stages of memory formation underscore the susceptibility of memory to distortions, strengthening the argument that our recollections are fallible. The discussion of false memories provides a powerful reminder of the limitations of an individual’s perspective, supporting my philosophy’s call to seek multiple viewpoints for a more accurate understanding of reality.
