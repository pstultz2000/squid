    <h2>Beauty and the Eye of the Beholder</h2>
    <p><strong>“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,” </strong>first said by Margaret Wolfe Hungerford (Phrases.org.uk), is a phrase most of us have heard- and it perfectly paints the value of a broad perspective. Frequently, we come across works of art and concepts that we personally do not find appealing, yet others do. While this may seem like a simple concept, it’s important that we take a moment to recognize that these different viewpoints are not inherently wrong or flawed. In fact, these differences in perspective can be attributed to those we spend time with.</p>
    <p><strong>For example, current research also shows that our parents tend to have significant effects on who we personally seek out in intimate relationships</strong>, providing us with a ‘template’ of sorts as we look for partners who resemble our parents in ways we find meaningful (Geher). This is relevant to our need to take a broader perspective because there are countless things we may not know that influences another’s decisions. Parental involvement clearly has a significant impact on a person’s relationships, but we may not hear about someone’s parents- or meet them- to gain a fuller understanding. Part of building a broader perspective is recognizing not just what we know, but what we don’t know.</p>
